Everything can spawn as loot. 

Candles are very sensible to wind and turn off easily. 

Turn on by holding a burning match/flare/torch and click the candle with the left or middle (AlternativeAction setting) mouse button.
Turn on by holding an unlit match and hold left or middle (AlternativeAction setting) mouse button while targetting the candle.
Turn off by left or middle (AlternativeAction setting) mouse button.

Flickering effect can be disabled in the mod settings. There are additional options for customizations.

Candle gives +2Â°C warmth while burning. Crafting and reading is possible.
